## notes
* The script attempts to prevent duplicates, but this has some holes... When `tidallister` finds a track, it strips out anything in parentheses.  So "Big Hit (2005 Remaster)" and "Big Hit (Live)" would both equal "Big Hit"
* **CONVERT SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS TO TIDAL**: There is also a `spotify-to-tidal.py` script, which just reads a Spotify playlist URL and outputs the command to use for `tidallister.py` - use it like so: `python3 ./spotify-to-tidal.py "http://insert-any-spotify/playlist/url"`
* **MAC APP / APPLESCRIPT GUI**:There is also a `TidalLister.app` folder which is an applescript app that likely won't work on your machine, but i can help you try
